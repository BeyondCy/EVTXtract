The problem is, of course, that you often just get fragments of evtx
files even when you're extracting them from cache (which makes sense
since we don't need the entire log in memory).  For one case I was
lucky that the log that was extracted was still parsable with Andreas'
scripts and sometimes with tweaking of either the file or his script
I've been able to get more on other cases.  On average you will find
1-3 ElfChunk sections in an extracted evtx which may or may not also
include an ElfFile section.  I've attached a sample extracted from
memory from a test Win2008 R2 VM for your testing purposes.

I don't think they are sensitive, IIRC this is from a test VM, but let
me send you some others that I know are "clean" for your test
directory.  In the meantime, I've attached these for your private
testing :-)

All the best,
